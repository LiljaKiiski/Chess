# Chess
This is my attempt at making a working chess program

# To-Do (Don't forget)
- Eventually remove History class, notations can just be stored as strings.
	- Only keep for storage of color for now - later on when players take turns moving pieces remove this
- Maybe rename History class to Move class?
- Add letters and numbers visually to chess board
