# Chess
This is my attempt at making a working chess program

# To-Do (Don't forget)
- Eventually remove History class, notations can just be stored as strings.
	- Only keep for storage of color for now - later on when players take turns moving pieces remove this
- Remove MyMouseListener's need for main.painter, check if tiles are on same color differently
