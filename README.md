# Chess
This is my attempt at making a working chess program

# To-Do (Don't forget)
- Add letters and numbers visually to chess board
- Remove helper methods in History class
- Change image names to just type
	- So just K.png for King, etc.
	- Removes extra variable in Piece
- Remember pawn turns to queen(or other chosen piece) when reaches end
