# Chess
This is my attempt at making a working chess program

# To-Do (Don't forget)
- Eventually remove History class, notations can just be stored as strings.
	- Only keep for storage of color for now - later on when players take turns moving pieces remove this
- Maybe rename History class to Move class?
- Add letters and numbers visually to chess board
- Make sure everything is fine with X and Y
	- Some clear system for when starting with 0 in arrays and starting with 1 on board "look"
- Change image names to just type
	- So just K.png for King, etc.
	- Removes extra variable in Piece
